# dotfiles
A collection of my dot files

Just copy the files to your home directory to get started. See my [setup script](https://github.com/paymaan/setup-machine/blob/master/setup-machine-impl) to install anything specific that the dot files use.

I have also been playing around with [atom](https://atom.io) and [nuclide](https://nuclide.io) recently. I maintain that config using [sync-settings](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings) package. The actual config is hosted as [my gist](https://gist.github.com/spraza/bea17df0c9661ab23e835fb3e3e0cf44).
